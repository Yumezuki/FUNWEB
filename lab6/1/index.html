                <h1>Programming language</h1>
                <p>A computer "speaks" in a "language" using strings of the numerals "1" and "0"â€”known as binary code. A programming language allows us to translate the computer's binary code into something humans can understand and write. These languages enable us to communicate with computers, build and organize code, specify functionality and behavior, automate and improve efficiency, collaborate and share code, and solve problems creatively.</p>

                <h1>Java</h1>
                <p>Java is known for its object-oriented programming paradigm, making it suitable for building large-scale enterprise applications. Developers use Java to organize code into classes and modules, promoting code reusability and maintainability. The language's structure helps in creating well-organized and structured software projects.</p>
